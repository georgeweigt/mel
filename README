mel.c runs Mel Kaye's blackjack program by simulating an LGP-30.

bkjck.txt needs to be in the working directory.

The first column of output is player's hand, second column is dealer's hand.

Enter one of the following to be dealt a card:

	yes
	ok
	si
	ja
	oui

Anything else means 'stand'.


% gcc mel.c
% ./a.out 



	A - c	6 - d
	2 - c
Card?
